we use AoA to perform downlink beamforming, so you can use a parameter called `deg` to generate signal of different angle in degree. in this case, no noise and fading is considered, so `N1=1` when performing  beamforming.

with only Doppler effect considered (but not Doppler fading), the time-CSI sequence would show on the
